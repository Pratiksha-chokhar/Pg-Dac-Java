Comparable								Comparator

 - compareTo (object)					- compare( object1, object2)
 - natural sorting						- customized sorting
 - in the class definition				- outside (without class definition)\
 - Student, Employee, 					- Any class
 - by default available in Wrapper class	- need to implement for user defined classes
 - only one sorting technique (natural)		- you can create any number of sorting
 
 home page  - display the students record by rollNo
 results	- display the students by marks
 
 

Reflection-
 
 - This is the process which provides way to analyze or examine your class and 
	its members
 - Also it provides capabilitis to modify the values of class members
 - You can access the private members
 - java.lang.reflect is the package 
 - Class provides all the methods to get the information about a particular class

Uses
 - debugger
 - intellicense
 - RMI - to generate stub methods
 
Read

 - class information
 - methods
 - constructors
 - fields
 
Class.forName ( "classname with package" )
Class c = String.class

 
Singleton Design Pattern
 - 
How to implement
 - make the constructors as private
 - create static variable of same class type 
 - create static method that returns the static reference variable 

 
Collections - class, utility class
Collection - interface, List, Set
 
 
 Vector, HashTable are thread safe by default
 ArrayList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap - all are not thread safe
