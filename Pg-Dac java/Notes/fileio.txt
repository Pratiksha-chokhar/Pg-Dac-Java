 Stream
  - Stream is sequence of data

 Byte based streams
 Character based streams
 
 - Handle input and output with bytes - Byte based streams
 - Handle input and output with character - character based streams
 
 java.util
 java.io
 
 Stream based
 - InputStream and OutputStream - abstract classes
 - This provides basic method for input and output
 - FileInputStream - FileOutputStream
 - BufferedInputStream - BufferedOutputStream
 - ObjectInputStream - ObjectOutputStream
 - DataInputStream - DataOutputStream
 
 input - read
 output - write
 
 
 Java Standard Streams
 - System.in   - read the character input from the console
 - System.out  - writes the character to console
 - System.err - this will writes the error on the console
 
 
 Character Based
 - Reader and Writer - are abstract classes
 - have basic method implementation of input and output
 - FileReader and FileWriter
 - BufferedReader and BufferedWriter
 
Types of files
 - binary files   - bytes based 
 - text files 		- character based
 - .exe, .jpg, .mp3 ....all are binary files
 - .txt is text files
 - binary files can be read by only specific application 
 - text files can be read by any text editors
 
 
 byte - 8 bits 
 char - 2 bytes -Uni code characters
 
Serialization::
 - This is the process of writing object to a file.
 - DeSerialization is reading the object form the file
 - Any class which implements Serializable interface are allowed for serialization
 - All primitive type variables can be save to the file
 - Any reference type variables should be implement the Serializable interface
 - when you declare a variable as transient, the variable ignored from the 
 serialization

Marker Interface
 - It does not have any method declaration, variables
 - Just like a empty interface
 - This gives a special instruction to the Java Compiler or JVM, so that these calsses
can be handled separately. 
 - Serializable
 - Clonable
 - Remote
